# Relational Mathematics (in Alloy)

Gunther Schmidt wrote a book called *Relational Mathematics*.  The code in this repository is my attempt at translating the ideas in that book into Alloy.  It is a work in progress.

If you are an experienced Alloy user and are concerned that my modules lack checks, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/coreflexive/relmath/wiki).  In it, you will find many pages explaining why I am confident my translations are accurate.  It is also a work in progress.

I hope you find what you are looking for.

Happy modelling.
