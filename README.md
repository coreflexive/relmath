# Relational Mathematics (in Alloy)

Gunther Schmidt wrote a book called *Relational Mathematics*.  The code in this repository is my attempt at translating the ideas in that book into Alloy.  It is a work in progress.

If you are interested reading about why I think my translations are accurate, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/coreflexive/relmath/wiki).  It is also a work in progress.

I hope you find what you are looking for.

Happy modelling.
